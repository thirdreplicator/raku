# Raku (æ¥½)

A simplified Javascript client for working with Riak 2.0, based on [no-riak](https://github.com/oleksiyk/no-riak).  "Raku" means "easy" or "simple" in Japanese and it kind of sounds like "Riak."  Basically, I wanted a client where i could just type

```javascript
set(key, value)
```

or

```javascript
get(key)
```

but I found that most clients take in a slew of arguments that I didn't wantto think about.  So, I took the most reasonable promise-based client that I could find, [no-riak](https://github.com/oleksiyk/no-riak) and wrapped it in a class.  

### Usage


```javascript
import Raku from Raku

raku = new Raku()

raku.set('mykey', 42)
  .then(() => raku.get('mykey'))
  .then(value => {
    console.log('mykey is ' + value)
  })
```

### API

This client only has only 3 operations: get, put, del.

#### set

```javascript
raku.set(key, value)
```

The value will be serialized as a JSON string before being stored.

#### get

```javascript
raku.get(key)
```

The result will be a promise that resolves into the corresponding Javascript data type.  For example, if the value was stored as a boolean, you'll get back a promise that resolves to a boolean.

#### del
````javascript
raku.del(key)
````

This will delete the key in the Riak database.

### More power

If you want the full power of a more sophisticated client, you can access the wrapped no-riak client like this:

```javascript
  raku.client # a no-riak client
  raku.NoRiak   # the no-riak module
```

See [no-riak](https://github.com/oleksiyk/no-riak) for details.

### NB

2016-12-13: I just started learning Riak, and just released this little wrapper for myself.  I'll be adding features as I learn more about Riak.  I'm happy to hear from anybody using this.  You can email me here: thirdreplicator@gmail.com
